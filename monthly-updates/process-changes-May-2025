# Project Workflow Changes - May 2025
We are making some changes to hopefully simplify and improve the way we are managing the Laptop Support and Usability Improvements project. These changes are based on the experiences and feedback so far, and we'll review their effectiveness over the next few months. 


## Changes to Our Project Board - What You Will See

### 1. Moving from Iterations to Release-Based Planning
**What you'll see:**
- Milestones will now reflect actual software releases (like "15.0" and "15.0MFC") instead of quarters
- No more iteration labels on issues
- More consistent use of "In Progress" and "Done" status indicators
- A new quarterly roadmap document in our repository

**Why we're making this change:**
Our work is heavily dependent on external contributors and community processes, making fixed time-based iterations impractical. This shift allows us to better align with FreeBSD's release cycles and provide more accurate public information about our progress.

### 2. More Timely Updates
**What you'll see:**
- GitHub issues updated more promptly (at month end)
- Less time lag between the end of the month and the publication of the monthly report
- More up-to-date information in the LDWG meeting

**Why we're making this change:**
We want to ensure our public-facing information is as current as possible. Our previous update cycle sometimes resulted in delays reporting progress, which made it harder for everyone to have a clear picture of the most recent progress.

### 3. More Developer Voices in the LDWG
**What you'll see:**
- More of our project developers directly providing updates in the call
- Demonstration slots for significant features

**Why we're making this change:**
We want to better showcase the individual contributions of our team members and provide more opportunities for interactive discussions about ongoing work. This helps everyone better understand the nuances of development progress.

### 4. Better Task Visibility
**What you'll see:**
- You *may* see more granular tracking of completed tasks using GitHub subtasks. This is a new feature of GH and we have asked developers to trial using it to log completed tasks. 
- Better documentation of incremental progress

**Why we're making this change:**
We want to improve visibility into the day-to-day progress being made, particularly for complex features that take significant time to complete.

## What This Means For You

These changes are designed to make our development process more transparent and our progress reporting more accurate. You should find it easier to track what's happening with specific features you're interested in, and get a clearer picture of our roadmap toward upcoming releases.

We welcome feedback on these changes as we implement them. Our goal is to make the project more accessible and understandable to all interested parties.
