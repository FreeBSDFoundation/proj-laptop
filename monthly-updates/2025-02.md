# FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update - February 2025

## Completed in February

### Tool to let users transition to using pkgbase 

A new tool called pkgbasify has been developed to enable laptop users to transition their existing FreeBSD systems to pkgbase management. This tool provides one of two critical paths for users to adopt pkgbase and is available at https://github.com/ifreund/pkgbasify. (The other path is [using the installer to intall pkgbase](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/37).) The implementation uses a 3-way-merge approach to handle configuration files, though it's currently best suited for converting fresh FreeBSD installations rather than heavily customized systems.

It is now ready for general testing, any bugs found should be logged against the tool repo. Moving forward, the focus will be on gathering bug reports and feature requests from users while continuing development of the second path: installer support for pkgbase.

## Work in review this month

### Sleep using S0ix and s2idle low power states

A new power management driver (acpi_spmc) has been developed that can understand device power requirements and help laptops enter deeper sleep states using S0ix suspend hooks. This will enable better battery-saving sleep modes such as s2idle. Support for the lowest power state, D3cold, was added, along with fixes to ensure devices properly transition between power modes.

Testing has started, but more rigorous end-to-end testing and debugging is needed.

### Fixing blockers to make Linux WiFi drivers work
To better support Linux WiFi drivers, work on the translation layer - the Linux Kernel Programming Interface (LinuxKPI) implementation in FreeBSD - has been ongoing as part of this project. The LinuxKPI layer is an interface layer that provides API-compatible implementations of many Linux kernel interfaces, greatly simplifying the adaptation of Linux driver source to FreeBSD. The current blocking problems relate specifically the way it currently handles memory allocations where there are differences between FreeBSD and Linux.  Wireless drivers such as rtw8x (Realtek) are not getting the contiguous memory allocation that they need when their requests are larger than a memory page. Work in February has focused on picking up some existing logged issues and getting them resolved. The resolutions are in review:

* https://reviews.freebsd.org/D46661 (accepted)
* https://reviews.freebsd.org/D46656 (accepted)
* https://reviews.freebsd.org/D46657 (needs follow-up work)

### WiFi 4 and 5 available for limited testing
WiFi 4 (802.11n) and WiFi 5 (802.11ac) support is now available to test for data rates at HT (High Throughput) and VHT (Very High Throughput) and on modern iwlwifi (AX2xx and BExxx) chipsets only. 
[A call for testing has been shared on the Desktop mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-wireless/2025-February/002964.html).

### Port of Linux 6.7 graphics drivers
The December [pull request to add support for Linux 6.7 graphics drivers to drm-kmod](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod/pull/332) is now waiting for related patches to be accepted. Of 26 submitted patches, 24 have been accepted. There is also a [related hardware pull request](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod-firmware/pull/36) that is open.

## Progress updates

### Power Management
#### Fixing bugs in S0ix and s2idle low power states

Work is in progress to address [sporadic wake incidents](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/55) in the new low power states functionality. 

#### Making it possible to debug suspend/resume development
It's hard to debug suspend/resume features in development if you only have one laptop (when it goes to sleep you can't use it any more). So, a key development technique is being able to debug a suspend/resume cycle in one laptop by connecting it to a second laptop via USB port. This is not currently possible.  

This month, work has been done on reviewing some proof-of-concept code already created in 2024. 

The testing of FreeBSD's USB debugging capability (DbC) has seen mixed results across three versions released in 2024: 
* The May version allowed partial debugging from the boot loader but the kernel incorrectly reported the capability as unsupported. 
* The July version performed worse, with a blank boot loader screen and continued kernel detection issues. 
* The August version showed improvement with better hardware detection and a functional boot loader, but suffered from resource allocation problems with the primary USB controller while successfully connecting to a secondary controller that doesn't link to external ports. 

Progress is currently stalled while we wait for newer source code from the original developer. The latest version was distributed only as a bootable image rather than source code, making it difficult to diagnose issues. Since all physical USB ports on the test laptop connect to the problematic first controller, the feature remains unusable. Independently fixing issues in older code would likely duplicate work already completed in newer versions, so obtaining updated source code is essential for moving forward with this debugging tool that would help diagnose suspend/resume issues.

#### Suspend and resume for LinuxKPI-based WiFi
Work is  underway to ensure that LinuxKPI-controlled wireless adapters follow the laptop in suspend and resume transitions. [LinuxKPI based WiFi suspend and resume](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/58)

### Compatibility and system requirements

#### Enhancing performance with heterogeneous cores
Work underway to improve CPU task management by [optimizing scheduling with 256-queue runqueues](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/54) is still in progress, but sufficiently complete to unblock its parent issue, [High performance from laptops with heterogeneous cores](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/22) which can start development once the developer receives a suitable laptop (due in March 2025). 

This work, once complete, will enable processes to be directed to either high-power "Performance" cores for demanding tasks or energy-efficient "Efficiency" cores for lighter workloads. By implementing these changes, overall performance is expected to improve while power consumption is balanced, resulting in a more responsive and efficient computing experience.

#### Improving support for non-standard audio jacks
There has been a re-think in the overall approach to supporting audio devices which should be more flexible in adapting to a range of edge cases.

The work which is underway improves how headphones and speakers work on the system. Currently, when apps use the default audio device, they connect to /dev/dsp, which is just a shortcut to whatever device is set as default. If that device gets unplugged, apps crash or stop working until restarted. The update creates a new virtual audio device system that works more like Windows, where each audio output gets its own separate device entry and a new virtual device called /dev/vdsp acts as a smart router. When apps connect to the default audio path, they're now connecting to this router instead. This means you can plug and unplug headphones without apps crashing, audio automatically switches between devices, and users no longer need extra software to handle these issues. Essentially, this change will make audio devices work more reliably and intuitively on FreeBSD.

#### Making it possible to install pkgbase from the installer
Installing pkgbase is something that most FreeBSD users do when installing FreeBSD, and therefore adding the option to install pkgbase via the FreeBSD installer will benefit many people. Work has now started to add this option: [Support in the installer to install pkgbase](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/37).

#### Port of Linux 6.8 graphics drivers
In parallel to the progress of Linux 6.7 graphics drivers through the review process, there is also work being done on porting the [Linux 6.8 graphics drivers](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/49). This work is around 25% complete, and includes addressing feedback given on 18 existing relevant patches in Phabricator.  

#### Additional work on WiFi 4 and 5 support
Although support for WiFi 4 and 5 is in review for some use cases (see above), support for other uses cases is still under development. [Some bugs are being tackled for LinuxKPI 802.11](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/57).
