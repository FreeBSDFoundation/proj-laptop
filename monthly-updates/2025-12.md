## In Review
#### S0i3 Modern Standby
Some ongoing improvements and bugfixing to the S0i3 Modern Standby functionality were worked on this month. This includes S2idle (suspend to idle mechanism) and SPMC (System Power Management Controller) functionality. 

GitHub issue [#32](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/32)


## In Progress

### Installation
#### KDE Desktop Installer Option 
A desktop environment option for the FreeBSD installer is in progress. We aim to have it ready for 15.1. This month we have refactored the code and added an NVIDIA GPU selection menu, with plans to test this, add VirtualBox and VMware compatibility, and integrate everything into bsdinstall.

GitHub issue: [#25](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/25)


### Power
#### S4 hibernation
The team is working on an iterative approach to the S4 solution as we are expecting unknown elements to emerge along the way. 

Development work has started on saving the computer's state into an S4 image so we can move on from using a dummy image.  

Tooling that creates a dummy S4 image and reboots FreeBSD from it is complete and CI pipelines are being added for it.

#### Debugging tools for low power states
Three different USB-based debugging approaches are in progress. 

##### USB Debug capability (DbC)

*No update this month.*

We now have a working proof of concept for USB-C debugging between two laptops. Testing revealed that a USB3 debug cable combined with two USB-C/USB3 adapters successfully establishes an xHCI debug connection. This configuration has shown us the specific pin connections needed to create a custom USB-C cable adapter. Once we have this adapter, it will make debugging significantly more accessible for developers, eliminating the need for specialized cables that are both difficult to source and expensive.

##### Hardware debugging tool

We have been testing the custom circuit board that activates the UART communication feature on newer Framework Laptops' main processor and it works successfully with the laptop's embedded controller. We got it working as a boot console so we can see what's happening during the computer's startup sequence. This means we can diagnose problems that occur during early boot-up, when the laptop wakes from sleep, or when issues prevent the normal screen display from working. Right now, there's a bug in the test laptop's firmware that's causing problems, and we're working on a fix to get everything running properly.


##### USB serial debugging
*No update this month.*

As in previous reports, support is functional in all FreeBSD releases with some caveats. Further work is postponed while other debugging methods are developed. 

We will publish documentation for all debugging solutions in the FreeBSD handbook chapter once the work is complete.

### Wi-Fi

#### Support for RealTek Wi-Fi cards
Work continues on Wi-Fi 5 support for rtw88 and rtw89 drivers. Currently, the rtw89 driver can successfully receive data and handle Block Acknowledgment (a feature for efficient data transfer), but transmission speeds remain stuck at the slowest basic rates and won't increase. We are being cautious with fixes because the changes affect core systems shared with other drivers (e.g. the iwlwifi driver), so improvements are being rolled out gradually in smaller pieces to avoid breaking existing functionality.

GitHub issue: [#99](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/99)

#### Support for MediaTek Wi-Fi cards
Work on mt76 driver (which will support MT7921/7922 chipsets) for Wi-Fi 4/5 support is progressing alongside the RealTek development, with much of the work applicable to both. Some improvements to LinuxKPI infrastructure (specifically `struct page` handling) have been completed. Progress remains blocked by pending additional LinuxKPI infrastructure work, specifically page pool implementation and drm-kmod integration requirements.

GitHub issue: [#66](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/66)

### Graphics
#### Port of Linux 6.11 Graphics Drivers
Work on porting the Linux 6.11 graphics driver has started with work on drm-kmod.

GitHub issue: [#52](

### System management
#### Making pkgbasify safer to use
Development work continued on pkgbasify, a tool designed to convert existing non-pkgbase FreeBSD installations to use pkgbase with minimal risk. The focus shifted toward implementing a safer conversion approach using package registration rather than file overwriting. The approach involves implementing support for `pkg install --register-only`, which allows registering packages in the pkg database without modifying filesystem files.

### Integration testing

#### Holistic testing for laptop project functionality
Our testing project is starting in January, please see the dedicated GitHub repo for more details:
