# FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update - May 2025

## Completed in May

### The FreeBSD installer now supports offline packaged base installation

Users can now install a pkgbase system without requiring network access. Currently, users have to build this themselves, however we aim to have this implemented in the weekly snapshots soon. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/70 

### The FreeBSD installer now supports choosing additional packaged base components upfront

Users can now customize their FreeBSD installation upfront by selecting additional desired system components in the installer beyond just the minimal base system.

## Work in review this month
### Support for more WiFi security protocols
Support for better performance in more security protocols for WiFi 5 support for iwlwifi (Intel devices) is in review or in a final test build before being pushed into main. This work specifically tackles offloading cryptography processing to hardware when it encounters different security protocols used by the WiFi network. Support for WEP is being deprecated as it is old and unsupported. Better support is now provided for CCMP, GCMP, and TKIP protocols. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/64

### MediaTek WiFi driver
The code has been integrated into FreeBSD's main development branch but remains disabled. We're waiting for Linux compatibility layer (LinuxKPI) changes to be finalized to avoid merge conflicts. The drivers compile and load successfully, but a hardware initialization issue prevents receiving data - the same bug MediaTek fixed in Linux in 2023. Additional debugging is needed to resolve this and occasional PCI device detection problems. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/66 

### Port of Linux 6.7 graphics drivers
> This functionality remains in review from last month, but there has been some progress with the review. Please see the GitHub issue for the latest updates. 

The December [pull request to add support for Linux 6.7 graphics drivers to drm-kmod](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod/pull/332) now has all patches to linuxKPI in the FreeBSD main branch and is being reviewed and tested prior to being merged.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/47

### Port of Linux 6.8 graphics drivers
> This functionality remains in review from last month, but there has been some progress with the review. Please see the GitHub issue for the latest updates. 

The port of Linux 6.8 graphics drivers is waiting on the 6.7 pull request to be merged, but is otherwise complete and is being tested to prepare for merging.

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/49 

### LinuxKPI Memory allocation handling 
> This functionality remains in review from last month, but there has been some progress with the review. Please see the GitHub issue for the latest updates. 

This work is complete and in review. It updates how memory allocation is handled by LinuxKPI.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/60 


## Progress updates
### Power Management
#### Modern standby
Work on S0ix and s2idle is still sitting behind an [upstream patch](https://github.com/acpica/acpica/pull/993) that needs to be reviewed and accepted. The upstream project has agreed to work with our code-slush August deadline so that we can get this work into FreeBSD 15.0.
GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/32

Work on S0i3 is progressing but we are still hitting some challenges on managing the sleep state for USB4/thunderbolt ports. Debugging continues.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/55

#### Stopping unwanted wake from sleep state
The work to stop spurious wakes from s2idle has delivered a workaround approach to put the laptop back to sleep if it can be determined that it woke up for a non-valid reason. The underlying problem should be addressed as part of GitHub issue [#32](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/32) .

GitHub issue:  https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/55

#### USB debugging tool
Work to create a USB debugging tool for suspend/resume development has now reached a functional state. The tool is available in a branch and will be helpful in future suspend/resume development work. No change on this issue in May, with focus being on the USB serial adapter mentioned in the next section.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/38

Additionally, we are looking into a way to make it possible to do this debugging without the need for a specialist (xhci dbg) adapter. Instead, we hope to enable using a USB serial adapter. This new approach has made great progress, and you can see the debugging steps in the GH issue.Some remaining areas need to be addressed to establish full functionality.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/73  

#### Enhancing performance with heterogeneous cores
The work item to improve CPU task management (optimizing scheduling with 256-queue runqueues) is in review and close to being committed to CURRENT with the aim of having these added to 14.3 after a month (see the series of reviews in the Stack section of  https://reviews.freebsd.org/D45387). This item is a dependency for developing a way to have processes execute on the Performance cores in priority or, conversely, on Efficiency ones when the policy is to conserve battery as much as possible. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/54

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/22

### WiFi

#### WiFi 6 support 
Work is in progress, with much of the effort being directed to updating net80211, an underlying component that is needed to develop the WiFi 6 functionality. A new subissue has been created to track this dependency.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/34 

#### Intel WiFi followup tasks
Issues related to the recently completed [iwx support for WiFi 4 and 5 by Intel devices](monthly-updates/2025-03.md) are now being worked on. These include Suspend AND resume functionality, automatic rate selection for vht networks, resolve re-association issues, good defaults for networks, propagate regdomain updates, and hardware crypto offload.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/72 


#### Suspend and resume for LinuxKPI-based WiFi
Work continues to ensure that LinuxKPI-controlled wireless adapters follow the laptop in suspend and resume transitions. A blocker in the LinuxKPI PCI code has been resolved but this uncovered other problems with crashing drm-kmod and this will be the next focus for the work. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/58 

### Compatibility and system requirements

#### Creating an installer for KDE 
We aim to have at least a bare minimum way to install KDE for 15.0. This will likely be offering users a desktop installation. If they do, then with little or no intervention, we install and configure everything that is needed.  Upon reboot they should be presented with a KDE graphical login.
GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/25 

#### USBHID peripherals support
Support for USBHID will make it possible to use modern peripherals, especially USB mice/keyboards, and games controllers, and also enable speciality keys on the keyboard. There is work in the community that we are tracking and advocating for to help get it through review so that it will benefit laptop users.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/75 

#### Support for non-standard audio jacks, and automatic audio switching
Work continues on improvements to audio device handling, especially those with non-standard pin arrangements on the audio jacks. 

Selecting the most appropriate approach has been challenging, and several approaches have been tried. Each has had pros and cons for related functionalities such as audio hot swapping, and syncing audio input/output feeds, or audio/video feeds. 

We plan to take some time now to review what we have learned and consolidate our understanding of the requirements and favored technical solution before taking the next step.

You can read more about the most recent approach here: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50070 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/17

#### Specialty keys
We propose to limit the scope of this work to the target desktop environment (KDE). Some baseline testing has now been done. Note: USBHID work will also relate to this. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/19 

#### HDMI support
Some preliminary contextual information has been gathered.
