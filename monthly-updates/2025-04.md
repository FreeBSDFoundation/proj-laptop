# FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update - April 2025

## Completed in April
### Support for Realtek wireless drivers 
Updated support for Realtek wireless drivers rtw88 and rtw89 is now in main, and will be in 14.3 soon. To test these, please go to [the wireless mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-wireless/2025-April/003303.html).

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/66

### The FreeBSD installer now installs pkgbase in 15.0-CURRENT

Users can now install a pkgbase system using bsdinstall on 15.0-CURRENT. The current state is not feature-complete, as it doesn't support offline installation, but will be in 15.0 release. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/37 

### Support for TKIP WiFi security 

New functionality that provides better performance for the TKIP WiFi 5 security protocol is available  in FreeBSD 14.3-R but has to be turned on manually. If you would like to test it, go to [the wireless mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-wireless/2025-April/003243.html). 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/64 

### Intel WiFi firmware removed
iwlwifi has been removed from the core system (src.git). From now on, users will need to install the firmware through the package system instead. The `fwget` tool makes this simple.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/57

### Changes to the project processes
At the end of April, some changes were announced to how we will be managing the project. Mostly this relates to how we are structuring the planning and reporting cadences. For more information, and to see the Q1 roadmap document, please go to:

## Work in review this month
### Port of Linux 6.7 graphics drivers

> This functionality remains in review from last month, but there has been some progress with the review. Please see the GitHub issue for the latest updates. 

The December [pull request to add support for Linux 6.7 graphics drivers to drm-kmod](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod/pull/332) now has all 26 related patches accepted, however, one patch has a conflict with another patch that will be resolved shortly and this work will then be complete.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/47

### Port of Linux 6.8 graphics drivers
> This functionality remains in review from last month, but there has been some progress with the review. Please see the GitHub issue for the latest updates. 

The port of Linux 6.8 graphics drivers is waiting on the conflict in 6.7 to be resolved, but is otherwise complete.

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/49 

### Automatic audio switching
Available to test is new functionality that supports hot-swapping for audio devices. Anyone currently using an audio server (e.g., virtual_oss) for this purpose should no longer need to use that workaround. Hot unplug also works with no problems.

To test this, please go to [the multimedia mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-multimedia/2025-April/002944.html).

An alternative approach to how jack plugging inside HDA (High Definition Audio interface for sound cards) is handled is also in review:  https://reviews.freebsd.org/D50070
This may replace the previously mentioned approach.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/17

### LinuxKPI Memory allocation handling

Some WiFi tech debt has been addressed. Updating how memory allocation is handled by LinuxKPI is complete, and follow up work is in review. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/60 


## Progress updates
### Power Management
#### Stopping unwanted wake from sleep state
The work to stop spurious wakes from s2idle is now progressing by taking an approach to put the laptop back to sleep if it can be determined that it woke up for a non-valid reason.  

GitHub issue:  https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/55

#### Modern standby
Work on S0i3 is progressing but we are hitting some challenges on managing the sleep state for USB4/thunderbolt ports.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/55

#### USB debugging tool
Work to create a USB debugging tool for suspend/resume development has now reached a functional state. The tool is available in a branch and will be helpful in future suspend/resume development work. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/38

Additionally, we are looking into a way to make it possible to do this debugging without the need for a specialist (xhci dbg) adapter. Instead, we hope to enable using a USB serial adapter. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/73  

### WiFi

#### Intel WiFi testing
The recently completed [iwx support for WiFi 4 and 5 by Intel devices](monthly-updates/2025-03.md) is now going through some testing and bugfixing. Once these issues are resolved a call for testing will be announced.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/72 

#### Better performance for more security protocols
Support for better performance in more security protocols for WiFi 5 support is being further developed for iwlwifi (Intel devices). This work specifically tackles offloading cryptography processing to hardware when it encounters different security protocols used by the WiFi network. 

As part of this issue,support for WEP is being deprecated as it is old and unsupported.  Better support is being provided for TKIP, CCMP, and GCMP. 

As mentioned above, the higher-performance for the TKIP protocol is now available to test.

GCMP support is code complete and being tested. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/64 

#### Mediatek drivers
Support for Mediatek wireless drivers was waiting to be merged behind the newly merged Realtek drivers (see above) so this should be the next area of focus. The driver will need further work before it can be enabled.

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/66 

### Compatibility and system requirements
#### Support for custom kernel configurations in the installer
Work is now focusing on giving more control for the user to select specific pkgbase components during installation so that the user can have options other than a default set. 

GitHub issue: https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/71
