# FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update - December 2024

## Completed in December
### New documentation on how to update graphic drivers

Developers who wish to add support for a new DRM driver from Linux into FreeBSD can now follow a [set of instructions](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod/wiki/Porting-a-new-version-of-DRM-drivers-from-Linux) to get a Pull Request submitted to [drm-kmod](https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod).

This is helpful as it captures knowledge in the community and shares it in a format that means more people can help update graphics drivers. Note: our project aims to incrementally update through newer Linux versions, with a goal of reaching Linux 6.12.

### Driver (POC) for Intel WiFi interfaces (based on OpenBSD/Haiku)

To create the first implementation (Proof-of-Concept) iwx driver for FreeBSD, source code was imported from OpenBSD via Haiku to create a functioning driver with minimal modifications. We undertook this exercise to understand the workload and maintenance effort involved in different approaches to bringing WiFi drivers to FreeBSD -- the LinuxKPI-based iwlwifi driver is still supported.

The driver has now achieved network association and full functionality in 802.11a/b/g networks, capable of saturating theoretical maximum transfer rates in both 'a' and 'g' bands.

It has been intentionally designed with instabilities to accelerate crash detection, and has demonstrated reasonable stability in virtual machine environments.

After Future Crew's iwx source release in December, additional features and FreeBSD-specific functions were integrated. The proof-of-concept phase is now complete, with January development focused on enabling HT rates and preparing the driver for broader user testing.

Note: Driver is currently under active development and not yet recommended for production use.

## Work submitted for review in December

### Graphics drivers for Linux 6.7
DRM driver code has been ported from Linux 6.7 to `drm-kmod`. Testing of i915 and amdgpu drivers for use in common tasks such as coding, browsing, and video playback have shown no regressions.

A longstanding bug in the i915 is still present and manifests in corrupted display in the terminal. This is caused by a failure to register a fictitious memory range during the initialization of the code that integrates the the i915 driver and vt(4).

As part of January's work, this bug will be addressed, after which the upstream changes will be submitted to linuxkpi, and the FreeBSD changed can then be considered for merge.

## Progress updates
### Compatibility and system requirements
#### Laptop models
We are working to establish a [list of laptops](../supported/laptops.md) that our work will be developed for, and tested on. At the moment, we have committed to one model: [Framework Laptop 13 - AMD Ryzen 7040â„¢ Series](https://frame.work/ca/en/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd/configuration/new). To join the discussion on which laptops are on the list, we encourage you to [join the Desktop mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-desktop) and follow up to the ["FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Support target hardware and desktop environments" post](https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-desktop/2025-February/005427.html).

#### Desktop environment compatibility
We are working to establish a [list of desktop environments](../supported/desktop-environment.md) that our work will be developed for, and tested with. At the moment, we have committed to one: KDE with Wayland.
To join the discussion on which desktop environments are on the list, we encourage you to [join the Desktop mailing list](https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-desktop).

### Installation and system management
Work in December has begun addressing [technical debt in pkg](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/46) to enable PkgBase development that will eventually allow [support in the installer to install pkgbase](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/37) and we will also [create a tool to let users transition to using pkgbase](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/26).

### Bug Fixes and Technical Debt Management
As well as addressing the technical debt in pkg (see above), fixes for switching device power states (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D48385) were made to respect the device constraints necessary for entering lower power idle states (part of [Implement S0ix low power states and s2idle](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/32)).

Work to support implementation of newer WiFi standards includes an ongoing development of the [translation layer for Linux drivers on FreeBSD](https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/30).
