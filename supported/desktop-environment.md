# Desktop environments

A number of desktop environments are supported on FreeBSD, and developers
working on the Foundation's Laptop Support and Usability Improvements
project use a variety of different environments in their day-to-day work.
To focus and coordinate development and testing effort we choose to target
a small subset of environments.

The FreeBSD Project's Laptop Desktop Working Group (LDWG) survey showed a
strong preference for KDE, followed by XFCE and Gnome.  The survey showed
similar interest in X11 and Wayland, with a slight preference for the
former.  However, Wayland support is a requirement for long-term viability
of the desktop software stack on FreeBSD.

## Committed

* KDE with Wayland

## Candidates

Development of this list is being tracked in https://github.com/FreeBSDFoundation/proj-laptop/issues/28

Potential options include:
* kde
* xfce
* gnome
* sway
* river
* mate

For each of these X11 and/or Wayland may be applicable
